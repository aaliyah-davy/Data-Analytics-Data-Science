# Portfolio

My projects are centered around creating feedback for businesses in different stages of development:
- Analysing customer feedback
- Predicting monthly sales 
- Detecting potential security risks
- Visualizing employee attrition

_Software: Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML_

I am a published Duke Grad with a background in genetics and genomics, including but not limited to data collection, data analysis, hypothesis testing, heuristics intuition, and more. I'm a team-player who enjoys collaborating with others to develop tools of great impact and value.
